# âš™ Integrations

**Overview**

Toki functions best when all of a merchant's onsite and offsite integrations are integrated.&#x20;

**How to**

In order to set up Integrations, click on your account info in the top righthand corner, then go to **Settings**.  After **Settings**, click on **Integrations**.  Click **Add new integration** to what is available. Each integration requires different set up steps, most including copy and pasting keys from the third-party platforms.

Once you have done this, you will be able to choose these integrated platforms as you set up your **Activities**.
