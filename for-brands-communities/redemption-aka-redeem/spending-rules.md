# ⏱ Spending Rules

**Overview**

Spending Rules are specific guidelines you as a merchant can set your program to operate under, allowing your users to spend their tokens on discounts or free products.

There are two types of Rule available - **Global Rules** and **Isolated Rules**.&#x20;

**Global Rules** allow a user to spend their tokens on an outsized discount.

**Isolated Rules** allow a user to spend their tokens for a free product.

You get to determine the conversion rate of the token to $ ratio (i.e. how many tokens equal one dollar) via **Redeem > Spending Rules** in your Merchant Portal.&#x20;

**How to**

**A Global Set-up (in the Merchant Portal)**

The inputs for creating a Global Spending Rule are fairly straightforward. Just make sure you turn on the Status to orange after creating it.

In order to complete the set up for Global Spending, you must implement the Global Spend Module within your Shopify Theme. [Go here for a thorough walkthrough](../onsite-design/global-spending-module.md).

**An Isolated Set-up (in the Merchant Portal)**

To start setting up Isolated Rules, you're going to want to decide which products you want to offer to be tradable for free in exchange for tokens.&#x20;

We suggest actually creating product duplicates so you can keep track of the inventory for free products. You will then need to create a new collection in your Shopify account and add these product duplicates. As you can see in our video below. Our collection with duplicates is called "Isolated Collection"&#x20;

You then are free to create your rule!
