# ‚è± Spending Rules

### **Overview**

Spending Rules are guidelines you can set your program to operate under, allowing your users to spend their tokens to receive discounts.

üö®Before you set up a spending rule, it is important that you have set up your [Assets](../assets.md) üö®

There are two types of rules available - **Global Rules** and **Isolated Rules**.

Global spending rules are in use throughout your website

Isolated spending rules are specifically for token gated shops - learn more about token gated shops **here**

**Global Rules** allow a user to spend their tokens on a discount code, to be used on any product

**Isolated Rules** allow a user to buy a designated product (or products) with only tokens

### **Global Spending Rules**

We recommend setting your global rule to 100 Credits = $1. This is the simplest thing for your customers to understand, and allows you to give out higher values of credits without giving away the store.

Please note you can only have 1 Global Spending Rule

Here is how to set up a global spending rule:

1. From the Merchant Portal, click Redeem
2. Click [Spending Rules](https://manage.buildwithtoki.com/redeem/spending-rules)
3. Click ‚ÄúCreate New Rule‚Äù in the top right
4. Enter the name of the rule (most people use ‚ÄúGlobal‚Äù, or the name of their asset)
5. Select Rule type - Global
6. Select Conversion Asset
7. Enter Conversion Value (100)

There are 3 additional settings you can add to your spending rule:

1. Max Discount Possible ($)
   1. You have the option to specify the maximum dollar amount that someone can receive as a discount on any given order
2. Minimum Cart Spend ($)
   1. You have the option to limit customers from getting a discount until they have a minimum dollar amount in their cart
3. Max Discount Possible (% of Order Total)
   1. You have the option to specify the maximum percentage discount a customer can get (based off their order total)
