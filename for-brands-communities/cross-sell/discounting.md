# ðŸ˜‹ Discounting

**Overview**

Discounting is an opportunity to cross sell and offer discounts to customers that are not yet your customers. For example, I have brand Lucky Lemons. And we sell exceptional lemons. But my best friend runs this brand Exceptional Oranges. We discuss and see an opportunity to share customers with one another. So, I would create a discount rule in my Toki portal giving Exceptional Oranges customers a 10% discount when they come shop at Lucky Lemons.

**How to**

To set up **Discounting**, go to **Cross Sell** then **Discounting.** From here, create a token discount rule.

You will need to go through the steps to set up the Discounting Module in your Theme as well, as seen in the video, more information on this can be [found here](../onsite-design/discounting-module.md).
