# ðŸ“– Program Set Up

Weâ€™ve pre-designed a few programs for you, based on what types of behaviors you want to incentivize, and what type of loyalty you want. Weâ€™ve divided programs based on how rewards are earned, and how they are redeemed.

**Earned vs. Paid Loyalty**

2 programs give customers the ability to earn store credit through activities, and 2 give customers the ability to buy store credit, and we have 1 hybrid that allows you to either earn or buy your way to points

**Tier Based vs. Spendable**

Deciding how to reward customers has never been simpler. Either they earn or buy their way into Tiers, and Tiers = Discounts + Perks. Or, they earn credits, and spend the credits like cashback. If you opt for a Tier Based program, points can NOT be spent.
