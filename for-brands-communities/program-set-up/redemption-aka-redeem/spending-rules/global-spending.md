# Global Spending

### **Overview**

We recommend setting your global rule to 100 Credits = $1. This is the simplest thing for your customers to understand, and allows you to give out higher values of credits without giving away the store.

Please note you can only have 1 Global Spending Rule

Here is how to set up a global spending rule:

1. From the Merchant Portal, click Redeem
2. Click [Spending Rules](https://manage.buildwithtoki.com/redeem/spending-rules)
3. Click “Create New Rule” in the top right
4. Enter the name of the rule (most people use “Global”, or the name of their asset)
5. Select Rule type - Global
6. Select Conversion Asset
7. Enter Conversion Value (100)

There are 3 additional settings you can add to your spending rule:

1. Max Discount Possible ($)
   1. You have the option to specify the maximum dollar amount that someone can receive as a discount on any given order
2. Minimum Cart Spend ($)
   1. You have the option to limit customers from getting a discount until they have a minimum dollar amount in their cart
3. Max Discount Possible (% of Order Total)
   1. You have the option to specify the maximum percentage discount a customer can get (based off their order total)

In order to complete the set up for Global Spending, you must design the spending module in the merchant portal, and implement the Global Spending Module on your Shopify Theme. Click [here](../../../onsite-design/product-page-components/global-spending-module.md) to learn more.
