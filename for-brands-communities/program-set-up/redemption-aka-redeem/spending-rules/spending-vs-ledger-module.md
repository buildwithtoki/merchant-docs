# Spending vs Ledger Module

### Spending Module&#x20;

With the Spending Module, a customer specifies the amount they want to spend either by using a sliding bar or typing the amount. We debit their balance with the specified amount and give them a coupon in the form of a discount code to use on the purchase. At this point, the code is already debited which means if they donâ€™t apply the code, they lose the balance after 24 hours



### Ledger Module&#x20;

The ledger module gives your customer a unique discount code which is tied to their total store credit balance.&#x20;

The balance will be debited only when the discount code is applied. With the ledger module, the customer cannot specify how much exactly they wants to spend, the entirety of the value is used on the order.&#x20;

If an order subtotal is greater than the balance, the balance after the purchase will be zero. If an order subtotal is less than the balance, the balance after the purchase will be the total store credit balance minus the order subtotal amount.&#x20;

In other words: If a customer has more credit available than the value of the purchase, the remaining value will remain in their account.
