# ðŸ§ž Klaviyo-Specific Activities

**Overview**

**Activities** are actions that customers can take to earn tokens - they are set up in your **Merchant Portal**.

Klaviyo is a great platform to set up all different types of activities, such as newsletter sign up, feedback surveys and much more!&#x20;

**How to set up a Klaviyo Specific Activity**&#x20;

1. Click **Reward** on the sidebar
2. Click **Activities**
3. Click **Create a new activity**
4. Name your activity (e.g. Email Sign Up or Feedback Form)
5. Select **Klaviyo** from the list of integrations
6. Select "**Form Submission**" from the list of "Activity Types"
7. Select the type of Asset you want to deliver (Credits or Collectibles)
8.  In a new window, go to your Klaviyo account to access the â€˜Form IDâ€™.&#x20;

    \
    The form ID can be found in the domain as the six digit code within the form you have created in Klaviyo.&#x20;
9. Copy this code and put in the Toki Activity Module.
10. Back in Klaviyo, make sure that you have set up the **Action** button on the final step to **Submit Form** and then **After Submit** to **Close Form.**&#x20;

**Keep in mind**

1. You can edit an activity at any time.
