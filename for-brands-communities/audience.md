# ðŸ«‚ Audience

**Overview**

Consider the Audience section of your Merchant Portal to be similar to your Customer Data Platform. In it, you can see exactly who has engaged with your loyalty program, how active they are and where else they have been active in the Toki network.

**How to**

You can take a look at a customer/user and get an understanding of their activity by clicking on their profile within the Audience Profiles page.

In order to make best use of the Toki Audience platform, take a look at the Segment tab. In Segment, you can Create a New Segment based on how many tokens someone has in their wallet.

Once you create a segment, you can export it to use within Airdrops or other marketing initiatives.
