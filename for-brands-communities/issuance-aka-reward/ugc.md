# ðŸ¥¡ UGC

**Overview**

Rewarding a customer/user for user-generated content (UGC), is a more complicated Activity and, thus, requires its own section in the Merchant Portal. Toki integrates with both TikTok to reward customers/users for UGC.

**How to**

To reward to UGC, first set up your social accounts within the Merchant Portal. Once you have done so, you have free reign to search throughout TikTok for tagged photos/videos which you might want to reward.

We suggest openly communicating with your users/customers/fans that you are going to do this by pushing marketing materials and even doing a giveaway if that fits the feel of your brand.

Once you have selected the content you want to reward for, you will need to choose the token you will be sending as well as the amount to send.

The tokens are sent via a comment on the piece of content. You will be able to customize the comment notifying the users of the tokens they are getting.&#x20;

At the end of a comment, Toki will auto-append a link which will act as a claims function. The link will be to a landing page that asks for the user to connect their TikTok account (thus validating that the right person is getting these tokens).&#x20;

If confirmed, they will then have access to claim their tokens. Mission accomplished!&#x20;
