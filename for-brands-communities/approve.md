# ðŸš² Approve

**Overview**

Fun fact, Toki competitors actually do not certify that someone actually do the activity that you are rewarding them for. That's right. If someone were to "Follow you on Instagram" and you are using, let's say, Yotpo. Yotpo rewards that person with the points but never actually checks that it was done. This means the system can be abused at any given time.

**How to**

In order to prevent this, we have set up a system where easily scammed activities (like social likes) can actually be set to be manually approved instead of automatically approved.

Watch below to see how to set this up and where you will find inbound approvals if you do choose to set up manual approvals.
