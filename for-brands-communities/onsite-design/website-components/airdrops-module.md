# ðŸ›« Airdrops Module

**Overview**

The Airdrops module allows you to check to ensure that the right person is receiving the Airdrop you have set up in your Toki portal.

**How to**

To implement, you are most likely going to want to create a new page inside your Theme editor. We named this new page 'airdrops'. On this page, you can customize as you like. But you're going to want to add the Airdrops module. You can really only promote one Airdrop at a time, as you are going to want to customize the messaging to fit your needs. For example, if this is an Airdrop you are sending on Instagram, you are going to ask them to input their Instagram handle in the field. Vice versa for email.
