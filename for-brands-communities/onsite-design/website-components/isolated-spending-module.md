# üç≠ Token Shop + Isolated Spending

**Overview**

Setting up a Token Shop is a way for your customers to buy products _exclusively_ with their tokens or store credit - no cash needed. There's a few things needed to set this up.&#x20;

1. Isolated Spending Rule - learn how to set up here
2. Isolated Spending Module
3. Token Shop&#x20;



**How to Design the Spending**

After setting up your Isolated Spending Rule, design the module in the Merchant Portal&#x20;

1.

    **How to Design the Spending Module**

    1. From the merchant portal, Click Design from the sidebar
    2. Click "Create Design"
    3. Write the name of the module you are creating - "Global Spending"
    4. Select "Global Spending Module" from the list
    5. Use the settings in the designer to customize what this looks like - text, colors, images, shape of the buttons, etc!

\*We suggest actually creating product duplicates so you can keep track of the inventory for free products\*&#x20;

As you will see in the below video, our original product "Chill Feelings" is in the regular "Shop" collection; however, we made a duplicate called "Chill Feelings - Special" which is in the "Exclusive Members Shop", the latter both of which have Isolated Rules applied to them.

Once the duplicates have been created, you must add them to their own collection. This is the collection that you have attached to your rule in your merchant portal.&#x20;

You want to make sure that you have a separate template for product pages and collection pages that relate to an Isolated Rule. We have created a new product template here called "isolated-product" and a new collection template called "isolated- collection".&#x20;

We then specifically add the Isolated Spending Module to the isolated-product page.

We then add the Price Mask to the isolated-product page and the isolated-collection page.

```
//    <div class="toki-price-tag-mask">
    {% raw %}
{% for collection in product.collections %}
      <div
        data-collectionId="{{ collection.id }}"
        data-moneyPrice="{{ money_price }}"
        data-price="{{ price }}"
      >
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endraw %}  
    </div>
```

Customize both however you see fit!&#x20;

And voila!
