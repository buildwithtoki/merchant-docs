# üèÅ Token Notification

**Overview**

The Token Notification Module lets your customers know that they have received tokens once they have taken an activity. This is unique to Toki and is how to create a gamified environment for your users. &#x20;

**How to**&#x20;

The Token Notification Module will show up on every page throughout your site. In order to set it up, go to your Theme and Customize. To implement on an independent page, go to Customize your Theme. Then go to the page you want to customize. You most likely to create a new template. Once you have done that, go ahead and add the Claims Module block. From here, you can customize which wallets show and the colors within the module. Note that the mp4 file you uploaded with your Digital Asset will be playing in the module- fun!
