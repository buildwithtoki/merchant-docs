# üç∞ Global Spending Module

**Overview**

The Global Spending Module is a way for your users to actually spend their tokens to get outsized discounts. To set this up, you will need to set up a Global Spending Rule within your merchant portal and then you will need to set up a Global Spending Module on the product pages you would like to allow this on.&#x20;

**How to**

We suggest setting up your Tiers Module on its own independent page with a few other modules that give a clear overview of your program and the benefits of it. Start by going to Customize your Theme and going to the unique page. You might want to create a new template. Once you've done that, toggle on the App block called Tiers Module and get customizing.
