# ðŸ’• Claims Module

**Overview**

The Claims Module is the core feature which allows your customers to collect their tokens. Claims modules should live on both the post purchase checkout page as well as on their own independent page.

**How to (on independent page)**

To implement on an independent page, go to Customize your Theme. Then go to the page you want to customize. You will most likely to create a new template. Once you have done that, go ahead and add the Claims Module block. From here, you can customize the module to your liking. Note that the mp4 file you uploaded with your Digital Asset will be playing in the module- fun!

Blah blah blah blah!
