# ðŸŽ¨ Onsite Design

**Overview**

Because Toki is integrated with your website, your customers should not be able to tell that they are using a third-party platform. We want to ensure that the consumer experience fits the look and feel of your website.

As a result, we have created different components that are customizable. You can put these components in different places on your website to explain your program, notify your consumers of what rewards they have and give them ways to use the rewards during their shopping experience.

Design Settings (across all modules)
