# ðŸŽ¨ Onsite Design

**Overview**

The most important part of Toki, is that your customers/users should not be able to tell that they are using a third-party platform. We want to ensure that the consumer experience fits the look and feel of your website.

As a result, we have 10 different Shopify components for you to utilize throughout your site to explain your program, notify your consumers of what rewards they have and give them ways to use the rewards during their shopping experience.
