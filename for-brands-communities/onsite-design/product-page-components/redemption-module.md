# ðŸ’­ Redemption Module

**Overview**

The Redemption Module is the access point to your customer's wallet. They will use this module in order to connect to see if they have any discounts or benefits attached to their account that can apply to their order.&#x20;

**How to**

We suggest setting up your Redemption Module to go on Product Pages. However, it can also go in the Shopping Cart (if you have access with your account and theme) or on the Checkout Page.

To do so, go to Customize your Theme and go to the page you would like to place the block. We suggest putting the block above the buy buttons so the customer gets to reap the benefits before purchasing. Once placed, you can customize the look and feel to your liking.
