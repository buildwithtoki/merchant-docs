# üèÑ‚ôÇ Activities Module

**Overview**

The Activities Module is the explainer which outlines to your customers what activities they should be taking in order to collect tokens from your brand. It is programmatically connected to your merchant portal so any changes to your program will automatically be synced to this module.&#x20;

**How to**

We suggest setting up your Activities on its own independent page with a few other modules (like the Tiers Module) that give a clear overview of your program and the benefits of it. Start by going to Customize your Theme and going to the unique page. You might want to create a new template. Once you've done that, toggle on the App block called Activities Module and get customizing.
