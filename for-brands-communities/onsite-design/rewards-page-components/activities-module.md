# üèÑ‚ôÇ Activities Module

**Overview**

The Activities Module showcases to your customers what activities they can take to earn store credit. It is programmatically connected to your merchant portal so any changes to your program will automatically be synced to this module.&#x20;

**How to**

We suggest setting up your Activities on a separate rewards page, that give a clear overview of your program and the benefits of it.&#x20;

Start by going to Customize your Theme and going to the unique page. You might want to create a new template. Once you've done that, toggle on the App block called Activities Module and get customizing.
