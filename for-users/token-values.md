# ðŸ¤‘ Token Values

ERC-20's and ERC-1155's (or "brand tokens" and "reward cards") that are minted and issued on the Toki platform do not have a fiat value at this point in time. Their value is exclusively commiserate with the rewards associated with them or with the exchange rate for free product as set by the specific merchant. In the future, "brand tokens" will have a flat fiat value that is equal accross the Toki Network.
