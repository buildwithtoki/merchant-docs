# ðŸš© FAQ

**How do I login?**

Login is done through the wallet. Each brand has a different login set up. Some use passwordless login, others use Shopify login. Either way, we suggest logging in with the email that you used for your most recent purchase. If you cannot remember this email, please reach out to support@buildwithtoki.com



**How does the wallet work?**

The wallet is your one stop shop for rewards. All of your discounts, store credit, perks, etc live in the wallet. You can complete any and all activities from the wallet, including adding your refer a friend link to your apple wallet! You can generate discount codes, check your tier status, and access all your perks and rewards from the wallet.



**How do I earn credit?**

There are three ways to collect store credit, points, cash back: completing activities, completing challenges, and completing voting activities/quizzes/surveys. You can view activities and challenges on the rewards homepage, on the homepage of the wallet, or by clicking "earn more credit".&#x20;



**How do I use the perks I unlocked with my reward tier or paid membership?**

Your perks can be found within the wallet under "your perks" and under your membership details. To use them click the "redeem" button and copy and paste the code at checkout.



**Can I use two codes at checkout?**

This is entirely dependent on the brand. Some brands allow coupon stacking, some don't. If you are unsure or having trouble stacking please reach out to the brand to see whether they support this or not.



**How do I spend my points, store credit, cash back?**

From the wallet, click the "spend credit" button on the homescreen. From here you will either see your "total code" or be given the option to enter an amount that you want to convert into a discount code. If using total code, copy that code and paste it at checkout. If entering your own amount, click enter and a discount code will show up for you to copy and paste at checkout.&#x20;



**What if I created a coupon but didn't use it at checkout?**

No worries! Your coupons are saved in the "your coupons" section of your wallet and can be used at any time.



**Do my points, store credit or tier status expire?**

This is entirely dependent on the brand you are supporting. They should communicate this in their wallet and rewards notifications. However, if you are unsure you can reach out to the brand or to support@buildwithtoki.com.



**How come my points/credits weren't automatically added to my account?**

Most likely, you did an activity or a challenge that required manual review! Hold tight while your brand manager reviews the action item and approves it. If you do not receive this credit, reach out to the brand's support center. If you know this was not a manual action and you did not receive your credit, please reach out to support@buildwithtoki.com
