# ü§ù Transfer Tokens to Friends

One of the cool things about blockchain technology is the transferability and exchangeability the infrastructure rails allows for.  In the past, you would not be able to send your "reward points" to a friend. Now, you can!&#x20;

To send a friend your tokens, they will need to have a Toki account premade. Once this is done, you will be able to send them tokens by going to Wallet then Send and inputting the email address associated with their Toki account.

Similarly, if someone were to want to send you tokens. You would need to provide them with your email address. Or to go to your **Wallet** then **Receive** and share your email address or allow them to scan your QR code.

We think of tokens as a virtual gift card that does not require annoying fees or purchasing hoops to jump through. Just one click and you can give your friend the gift of shopping perks.

**Keep in Mind**

1. Digital assets/tokens that are associated with Reward Tiers are non-transferable.&#x20;
