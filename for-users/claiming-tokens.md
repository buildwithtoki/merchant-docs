# üòÅ Claiming Tokens

After you complete an Activity that is worthy of tokens, you must claim your tokens. This provides security around the process to ensure others do not claim the tokens you deserve! You will find the ability to claim tokens:

If you have unclaimed tokens just sitting in your wallet, you will have a notification on top of the wallet. Seen in the right hand corner of the screen here.

All tokens must be claimed in the Toki wallet, however, you can tranfer your tokens to another wallet of your choosing at a later date.
