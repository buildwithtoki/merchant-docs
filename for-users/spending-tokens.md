Alternatively, the brand might have their own Token Spending shop full of products that can be purchased with tokens. To see if this is possible, reach out to the brand or look for a unique collection page on their site like this Exclusive Members Shop where you can get products for free with the exchange of DISCOCOINS.

Tokens can also be spent directly within the Toki wallet by going to **Wallet** and then **Spend**.
