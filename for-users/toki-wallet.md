# â˜‘ Toki Wallet

The Toki Wallet can be accessed 1) through a brands website 2) through a web extension and 3) through our mobile app. You do not have to download the extension or mobile app to use Toki. All functionality is available within the wallet plugin on a given brands website. However, if you are engaging with a brand that is not Shopify native, you might want to download these other applications.
