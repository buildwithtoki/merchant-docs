# 🍕 Store Credits + Cashback

**Overview**

There are two types of credits you can give to your loyalty members - store credit or cashback. As a default, your account will be set to give store credit. Each store credit is worth $.01. If you would like to change the name from 'store credit' to 'points' or something branded like 'JollyCash' you can go to Loyalty > Settings and change your **Store Credit Name.**&#x20;

If you would like to give **cashback** you will need to talk to your Account Rep or reach out to us at support@buildwithtoki.com to ensure you are on the right plan.
