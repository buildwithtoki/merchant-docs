# 🌟 Reward Tiers

**Overview**

Reward Tiers are a collection of perks you give your customers once they have collected a certain number of tokens OR completed a certain activity.

**How to Create a Reward Tier**

To set up reward tiers you must first have created the Toki assets - click here to learn how to do that

1. From the Merchant Portal, Click Loyalty on the sidebar
2. Click Memberships
3. Click “Create Membership”
4.  Choose your parameters\


    Decide what the parameters for entering the reward tier membership are - you can set it up based on collecting assets or based on completing an activity

    1. Store Credit - when someone collects a certain amount of store credit they enter the tier
    2. Activity Based - when someone completes a certain activity they enter the tier (you can also set this to be a purchase activity - think: buy this featured product, automatically get Gold Status!)
5. Choose your rewards - there are 8 different types of rewards you can grant - learn more about them [here](reward-tier-settings.md)
