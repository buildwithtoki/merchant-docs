# üòÅ Brij Integration

Integrating Brij with Toki makes it easy to drive your customers from a QR code to a branded onsite experience!

Here's how to set up the Brij Integration:

1. Go to your Brij portal
2. Click on Create New Experience
3. Select "Digital Hub"
4. Follow the instructions on screen!

Within Digital Experiences, you can link to any Toki pages you like - loyalty membership sign up, voting activities, polls, surveys, you name it.&#x20;

Here is a video showing off an example:
