# üçï Credits + Collectibles

**Overview**

There are two types of assets for you to create: Credits and Collectibles. Think of Store Credit as currency and collectibles as badges. Both can be used to unlock different perks - one is something you collect over time. Another is a delineation of unlocked benefits.

**These assets can be given to a customer three ways:**

1. Action Based: A customer can be automatically given an asset after completing any of your Activities
2. Unlocked: A customer can be automatically given an asset once they have taken a string of actions - completed a Challenge, or entered a Reward Tier.
3. Manually: A customer can be manually gifted tokens through an Airdrop (learn more about Airdrops here)

You can create your assets in the **Digital** **Assets** section of the **Merchant Portal.**
