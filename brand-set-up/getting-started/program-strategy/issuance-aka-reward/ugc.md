# ðŸ¥¡ UGC - Beta

**Overview**

Rewarding a customer/user for user-generated content (UGC), is a great way to incentivize engagement. You can set it up as an Activity for Instagram and Tiktok, but the UGC tab allows you to dive deeper into this function.

**How to reward for UGC**

1. Set up your social accounts within the [Settings](https://manage.buildwithtoki.com/settings/social) tab
2. Go to Reward > [UGC](https://manage.buildwithtoki.com/reward/ugc)  in the Merchant Portal&#x20;
3. From here, you can search through TikTok for #campaigns you've started or @users you want to look for.&#x20;
4. When you find someone you want to reward, you can send them an airdrop of store credits or tokens!

We suggest openly communicating with your users/customers/fans that you are going to do this by pushing marketing materials and even doing a giveaway if that fits the feel of your brand.

Once you have selected the content you want to reward for, you will need to choose the token you will be sending as well as the amount to send.

The tokens are sent via a comment on the piece of content. You will be able to customize the comment notifying the users of the tokens they are getting.&#x20;

At the end of a comment, Toki will auto-append a link which will act as a claims function. The link will be to a landing page that asks for the user to connect their TikTok account (thus validating that the right person is getting these tokens).&#x20;

If confirmed, they will then have access to claim their tokens. Mission accomplished!&#x20;
