# ðŸ“– Program Strategy

Based on research on the best loyalty programs in the world, we created four baseline program structures and created an easy to set up flow so you can set up your own world-class loyalty activation.

When deciding on which program you want to set up, you are going to want to consider these two choices:

**Earned vs. Paid Loyalty**

Of the four programs we suggest, two of them give your customers the ability to earn their way into reward programs through activities, and two of them give your customers the ability to buy into a rewards program. You can always set up multiple programs, as well, which we would call a "hybrid program".

**Tier Based vs. Spendable**

From there, it's critical to decide whether you want your customers be able to spend their store credit or not. If not, this means they will be forever accumulating credit and unlocking benefits from acquiring it over time.&#x20;

## **Here are the four suggested programs:**

**Paid Membership:** Allow your customers to buy a monthly, quarterly or annual membership in exchange for discounts + perks.

**Tiered Rewards Membership:** Allow your customers to earn their way into reward tiers and unlock cumulative discounts + perks.

**Deposit Membership:** Allow your customers to buy a membership and get future store credit. Example: Starbucks app; Put $50 on your card, get $60 in credit.

**Spendable Rewards Program:** Allow your customers to earn store credit through activities + spend their points on future purchases.

To set up a baseline program, we suggest going through the traditional onboarding flow.
