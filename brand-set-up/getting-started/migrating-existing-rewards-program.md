# â†” Migrating Existing Rewards Program

Now that you've designed your awesome new loyalty program, we know it's important to have continuity for your customers.&#x20;

Now, if you are going through the onboarding flow, then you've already seen how to do this. But if you haven't, please continue here.

Here is how to migrate your existing rewards program over to Toki:

1.  Download an export of existing loyalty members - necessary information is First + Last Name, Email and Points Balance&#x20;

    \
    Make sure this is in a **.csv** in the following format: **Last Name, First Name, Email, Points Balance.** The document must be **less than 4MB.** \
    \
    You can download a template for the .csv file under **Import** in the [Integrations](https://manage.buildwithtoki.com/settings/integrations) tab of Settings
2. Upload the csv
3. Enter the conversion value of your existing program (if 100 points = $1, enter 100)&#x20;
