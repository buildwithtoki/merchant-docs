# ğŸ¤© Understanding Analytics

At the top of Analytics, you will find the key numbers we look at the understand return on the platform for our merchants.

**Here is a key**

Value Generated: Value Generated = Loyalty Revenue + Referral Revenue

Loyalty Revenue: Loyalty revenue is attributed when a user uses a code that was either 1) associated with their rewards tier or 2) was generated when they spent their points at checkout. The revenue number is the equivalent of that cart value.

Referral Revenue: Referral revenue is attributed when a referrer shares their referral code and the referee makes a purchase. That revenue number is the equivalent of the cart value on the referee's purchase.

ROI: ROI = Value Generated / Cost of Platform

Brand Credits Issued: This is the number of store credits that have been issued over your designated period of time.

Membership Cards Issued: A membership card is issued whenever a user unlocks a reward tier.

Active Users: A user is registered as active as soon as they have done an activity that ellicits a reward.

Referrals Redeemed: A referral is registered as redeemed when a referrer shares their referral link/QR code and the referee makes a purchase. This value is the number of referrals redeemed over a period of time.
