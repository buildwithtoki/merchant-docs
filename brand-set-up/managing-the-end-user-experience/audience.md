# ü´Ç Audience

**Overview**

The Audience tab allows you to see exactly who has engaged with your loyalty program, how active they are and where else they have been active in the Toki network.

**Navigating the Audience Page**

**Profiles**: You can take a look at a customer/user and get an understanding of their activity by clicking on their profile within the Audience Profiles page. You can also search for profiles, and sort by date of profile creation

**Export Customer List:** You can export the customer list to use for marketing purposes

Search and Sort

**Create a Segment**

In order to optimize use of the Audience feature, we recommend setting up segments.

1. From the Audience tab, Click Segment.
2. Click ‚ÄúCreate new segment‚Äù
3. You can define a segment based on a few things:
   1. What someone has (tokens or collectibles)
   2. What someone has done (answered zero party data or voting activities)
4. You can add multiple requirements to enter a segment, making it an ‚ÄúAND‚Äù function or an ‚ÄúOR‚Äù function

Once you create a segment, you can export it to use within Airdrops or other marketing initiatives.

**Adding or Subtracting Tokens**

You can also manually add and subtract tokens for your customers directly in the merchant portal, from the [Audience tab](https://manage.buildwithtoki.com/audience/profiles)

If someone reaches out with a complaint, instead of giving them a discount code, you can offer them 500 points (or 1000, etc).

It takes just a few clicks!
