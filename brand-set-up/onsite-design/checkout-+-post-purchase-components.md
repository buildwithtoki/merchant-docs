### Post Purchase Module

From the designer in the merchant portal, you can create a post purchase module as well! This will show customers how much they earned on their purchase, and allow you to show off a featured activity or challenge (like referring a friend!)

**How to Design the Post Purchase Module**

1. From the merchant portal, Click Design from the sidebar
2. Click "Create Design"
3. Write the name of the module you are creating - "Post Purchase"
4. Select "Post Purchase" from the list
5. Use the settings in the designer to customize what this looks like - text, colors, images, shape of the buttons, etc!

### Checkout Spending Module

You can allow customers to decide how many credits they want to apply to their order at checkout using the Spending Module you created earlier.&#x20;

Here's how to put it on the checkout page:

1. Go to Shopify Settings > Checkout
2. Either create a new custom checkout, or customize an existing one
3. On the bottom left sidebar, click "Add App"
4. Click "Spending Checkout Module 2.0"
5. Move the module to whichever part of the checkout page you want
6. Click save + publish!
