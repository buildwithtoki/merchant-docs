# ðŸ’­ Redemption Module

**Overview**

The Redemption Module is how your customers can access the discounts and perks they have access to.

**How to**

We suggest setting up your Redemption Module to go on Product Pages. However, it can also go in the Shopping Cart (if you have access with your account and theme) or on the Checkout Page.

To do so, go to Customize your Theme and go to the page you would like to place the block. We suggest putting the block above the buy buttons so the customer gets to reap the benefits before purchasing. Once placed, you can customize the look and feel to your liking.
