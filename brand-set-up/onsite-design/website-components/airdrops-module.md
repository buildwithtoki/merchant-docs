# ðŸ›« Airdrops Module

**Overview**

The Airdrops module allows you to check to ensure that the right person is receiving the Airdrop you have set up in your Toki portal.

**How to**

1. Create a new page inside your Shopify Theme editor.&#x20;
2. Name this new page 'airdrops'.&#x20;
3. Add the airdrop module as a block on the page
4. Customize the page however you want from there!



\*Note\* You can really only promote one Airdrop per page, as you will need to customize the messaging to fit your needs. For example, if this is an Airdrop you are sending on Instagram, you are going to ask them to input their Instagram handle in the field. Vice versa for email.
