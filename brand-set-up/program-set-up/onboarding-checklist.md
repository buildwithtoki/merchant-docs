# â†” Onboarding Checklist

Congrats on making the decision to use Toki to reward your valuable customers!

Now that you've designed your awesome new loyalty program, we know it's important to have continuity for your customers.&#x20;

Here is how to migrate your existing rewards progam over to Toki:

1.  Download an export of existing loyalty members - necessary information is First + Last Name, Email and Points Balance&#x20;

    \
    Make sure this is in a **.csv** in the following format: **Last Name, First Name, Email, Points Balance.** The document must be **less than 4MB.** \
    \
    You can download a template for the .csv file under **Import** in the [Integrations](https://manage.buildwithtoki.com/settings/integrations) tab of Settings
2. Upload the csv
3. Enter the conversion value of your existing program (if 100 points = $1, enter 100)&#x20;
