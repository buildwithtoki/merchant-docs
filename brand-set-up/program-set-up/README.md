# ðŸ“– Program Set Up

Based on research on the best loyalty programs in the world, we created four baseline program structures and created an easy to set up flow so you can set up your own world-class loyalty activation.

When deciding on which program you want to set up, you are going to want to consider these two choices:

**Earned vs. Paid Loyalty**

2 programs give customers the ability to earn store credit through activities, and 2 give customers the ability to buy store credit, and we have 1 hybrid that allows you to either earn or buy your way to points

**Tier Based vs. Spendable**

Deciding how to reward customers has never been simpler. Either they earn or buy their way into Tiers, and Tiers = Discounts + Perks. Or, they earn credits, and spend the credits like cashback. If you opt for a Tier Based program, points are not spent.
