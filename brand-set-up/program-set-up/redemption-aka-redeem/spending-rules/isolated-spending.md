# Isolated Spending

### Overview

🚨Before you set up an Isolated spending rule, it is important that you have set up a separate collection in your Shopify store. 🚨 Read about Setting up a Token Shop here.

Once you have a Token Shop Collection, here is how to set up an Isolated spending rule:

1. From the Merchant Portal, click Redeem
2. Click [Spending Rules](https://manage.buildwithtoki.com/redeem/spending-rules)
3. Click “Create New Rule” in the top right
4. Enter the name of the rule (most people use “Global”, or the name of their asset)
5. Select Rule type - Isolated
6. Select the collection you created from the drop down list
7. Select Conversion Asset
8. Enter Conversion Value (100)
