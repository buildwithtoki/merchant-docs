# ðŸ’Ž Airdrops - To Edit

### **Overview**

Use Airdrops as a way to give customers a "one off" reward of tokens or credits.&#x20;

With Toki, you can whatever platform you want to send an airdrop - email, twitter, instagram. This works because the Toki platform autogenerates a landing page for the airdrop claim with a gate based on whether someone is on the allowlist or not. This makes Toki Airdrops very flexible.

**Airdrop CSV**

To set up an **Airdrop**, you can upload a CSV of the people you would like to send the airdrop to (net new loyalty users) or you can create an audience segment to airdrop to (prior loyalty users).

The main goal of uploading a CSV is to provide a way to gate the page so it's only available to those people in your list. You can use the format of whichever platform you're using (twitter handles, email address, etc)

Once you have uploaded the CSV, a token claim page is autogenerated with a form submission lock on top of it.&#x20;

### How to set up an Airdrop for New Loyalty Members

1. From the Merchant Portal, click "Reward"
2. Click "Airdrops"
3. Click "Create New Airdrop"
4. Fill out the Name, type of asset to deliver and the amount
5. Click Next
6. Upload your CSV (use example template if needed)
7. Copy the claims page link that is generated
8. Paste the claims link that was generated into whatever platform you want to use&#x20;

See video on how to do this here:

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/a329a1684dfc4f168bb1bfd4bcca4061" %}



These users will need to submit the appropriate data field in order to claim their digital assets.

To send the airdrop, send this claims page link to those you want to airdrop.&#x20;

### How to set up an Airdrop for Existing Loyalty Members

If you are interested in sending an airdrop to a segment of your current loyalty program, you are going to want to go to [**Audience** ](../../managing-the-user-experience/audience.md)**> Segments** > **Create a new Segment**.&#x20;

Once you have created the Segment, you will **Export that CSV**. You will then come back to Airdrops and create a new Airdrop and upload this CSV.&#x20;



**Customizing the Look and Feel**

The Airdrops Submission Module can be edited from within the Onsite Design section of the Merchant Portal. Read more about this in the [**Onsite Design section**](../../onsite-design/website-components/airdrops-module.md).
