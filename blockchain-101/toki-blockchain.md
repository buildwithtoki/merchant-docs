# â›“ Toki Blockchain

The Toki Network is a subnet on the Avalanche blockchain. The Toki blockchain is an EVM compatible blockchain. As a result, at this time, any ERC-20 or ERC-1155 issuance that is done through the Toki Merchant Portal is EVM compatible. &#x20;

The Toki blockchain currently consists of two validator nodes. If you are interested in being a validator node with us, please contact hello@buildwithtoki.com with the subject line "Validator Node".
