# ðŸª™ Toki Tokens



We support two types of smart contract tokens - ERC-20 and ERC-1155. ERC-20's are considered fungible tokens. ERC-1155's are considered semi-fungible tokens. Due to compliance and regulation, some platforms do not allow ERC-20 issuance. &#x20;

If you are interested in issuing this type of token and have concerns about doing so on your given platform, please reach out to us at hello@buildwithtoki.com with the subject line "Token Issuance"
