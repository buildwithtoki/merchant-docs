# ðŸ’² Tokenomics

ERC-20's and ERC-1155's (or "brand tokens" and "reward cards") that are minted and issued on the Toki platform do not have a fiat value. Their value is exclusively commiserate with the rewards associated with them or with the exchange rate for free product as set by the specific merchant.&#x20;

Right now, these tokens are also a part of a closed network so any exchange of tokens for fiat currency or cryptocurrency is not possible.

"Brand tokens" are exchangeable with one another in the Toki app through the Toki exchange. "Reward tier" NFT's are not exchangeable.

Users of the Toki network do receive $TOKI tokens in tandem with "brand tokens". These $TOKI tokens will have a utility and governance function in the future. Thus shopping with "Toki network" brands now, will have long-term benefits in the future.
