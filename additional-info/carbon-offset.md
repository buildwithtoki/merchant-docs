# ðŸŒ³ Carbon Offset

In 2022, The Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI) a renowned company in the field of crypto-related climate impact, systematically assessed the carbon efficiency of six leading proof-of-stake networks and their proof-of-work counterparts, including Avalanche (AVAX), Algorand (ALGO), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Tezos (XTZ), and Solana (SOL), as well as proof-of-work networks, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). &#x20;

In their research, they found the Avalanche public blockchain to use just 0.0005% of the amount of energy consumed by the Bitcoin blockchain. To break this down further, the report found:

* Bitcoin to consume the same energy as 8.5 million U.S. households in a given year
* Ethereum to consume the equivalent of 1.6 million U.S. households
* And the Avalanche network to consume the same amount of energy as only 46 US households.&#x20;

These findings were released in the _Energy Efficiency and Carbon Footprint of Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocols Report_ by CCRI - [read here](https://carbon-ratings.com/pos-report-2022).
