# â›“ Toki Blockchain

The Toki Network is a subnet on the Avalanche blockchain. The Toki blockchain is an EVM compatible blockchain. As a result, at this time, any ERC-20 or ERC-1155 issuance that is done through the Toki Merchant Portal is EVM compatible. &#x20;

The Toki blockchain currently consists of two validator nodes. If you are interested in being a validator node with us, please contact hello@buildwithtoki.com with the subject line "Validator Node".

More information on [Avalanche subnets](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/dev-foundations/intro-to-avalanche-subnets) can be found here.

We support two types of smart contract tokens - ERC-20 and ERC-1155. ERC-20's are considered fungible tokens. ERC-1155's are considered semi-fungible tokens. Due to compliance and regulation, some platforms do not allow ERC-20 issuance. &#x20;

ERC-20's and ERC-1155's (or "brand tokens" and "reward cards") that are minted and issued on the Toki platform do not have a fiat value. Their value is exclusively commiserate with the rewards associated with them or with the exchange rate for free product as set by the specific merchant.&#x20;

Right now, these tokens are also a part of a closed network so any exchange of tokens for fiat currency or cryptocurrency is not possible.

"Brand tokens" are exchangeable with one another in the Toki app through the Toki exchange. "Reward tier" NFT's are not exchangeable.

Users of the Toki network do receive $TOKI tokens in tandem with "brand tokens". These $TOKI tokens will have a utility and governance function in the future. Thus shopping with "Toki network" brands now, will have long-term benefits in the future.
