# â›“ Toki Blockchain

As a brand using Toki, you can decide whether you would like your assets to be minted on a blockchain or not.

The Toki Network is a subnet on the Avalanche blockchain. The Toki blockchain is an EVM compatible blockchain. As a result, at this time, any ERC-20 or ERC-1155 issuance that is done through the Toki Merchant Portal is EVM compatible. &#x20;

The Toki blockchain currently consists of two validator nodes. If you are interested in being a validator node with us, please contact hello@buildwithtoki.com with the subject line "Validator Node".

More information on [Avalanche subnets](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/dev-foundations/intro-to-avalanche-subnets) can be found here.

We support two types of smart contract tokens - ERC-20 and ERC-1155. ERC-20's are considered fungible tokens. ERC-1155's are considered semi-fungible tokens. Due to compliance and regulation, some platforms do not allow ERC-20 issuance. &#x20;

ERC-20's and ERC-1155's (or "reward cards") that are minted and issued on the Toki platform do not have a fiat value. Their value is exclusively commiserate with the rewards associated with them or with the exchange rate for free product as set by the specific merchant.&#x20;

Right now, these tokens are also a part of a closed network so any exchange of tokens for fiat currency or cryptocurrency is not possible.
